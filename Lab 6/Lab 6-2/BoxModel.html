                    <p>If there’s one thing that I’ve learned in all my travels around America, it’s that the US is more like a collection of small countries than one cohesive cultural unit. The lifestyle, language, and norms of each region differ vastly from one another. And even within states, there are vast differences.
                        The region that surprised me the most was “the South,” defined as the states that were part of the Confederacy, from the Mason-Dixon line to the Mississippi River and down to the Gulf of Mexico. (Texas was part of the Confederacy, too, but it’s generally not considered part of the “Old South,” because, well, it’s Texas and it’s its own beast!)
                        Growing up as a northerner, I always kind of looked down on the region as “backwards,” but, through a few trips around the area, I found that my perceptions about the region were wrong.

I grew to love my time exploring that part of the country. Sure, the South has its problems, but it has a lot more diversity, history, and natural beauty than my preconceived prejudices had allowed.

I don’t think it should be overlooked.

And, since domestic travel is our best option during these COVID times, I thought I’d share my suggestions for an amazing road trip around “the Deep South.”

The South is so big you can’t do it in just three weeks, but you can do what, for the intents of this post, I call the “Deep South”: Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Tennessee (which isn’t actually part of the Deep South, but hey, it rounds out the route!).

This region has a ton of parks, lakes, rivers, historical sites, and places to see. You’d need more than three weeks to properly see it but the route below gives you a proper overview:

Note: There are many, many, many potential routes you can take through this region. This three-week version is just some highlights I like. Tailor any route to your needs as you please!
